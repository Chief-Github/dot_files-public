#  My dotfiles üêß

My personal collection of configuration files for my Arch Linux setup running the Hyprland compositer.

## Why This Exists

I made this repository for two main reasons:
* To learn more about Git and GitHub.
* To make it easy for my dad (and you!) to download and try out my configs!

## My Setup
* **OS**: Arch Linux
* **WM**: Hyprland
* **Bar**: Waybar / AGS
* **Terminal**: Kitty
* **Shell**: Bash with Starship
* **Hardware**: Lenovo Thinkpad T480

## Desktop

*wallpaper changed for privacy reasons*


## Things to do if you download this
* Create a screen shots folder in your home directory
* Most wallpaper/backgrounds point to "/wallpaper/firstcar.jpg", please change this to your own img :)

*This is a work in progress!*
